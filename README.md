## Using with Linkedin

![Job Scrapdata V2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e122ae0d-c09e-444f-9c91-851a9ecd1ba5)

# Features
- Standalone Search
- Automated LinkedIn job details fetch

# Motivation

I felt it difficult to navigate between Job description and the Review site to get the salary estimate for the job role. So created a this extension to make it easier to access the required details.

# Thanks

- Ambitionbox - used their api for fetching the data for the job description
